# WAGEWHEEL: Your Favorite Way To Bet -- Project #2 


## Description

So we decided to create a betting website for our second project. To hit all the criteria, we created a betting website that takes user information and input 
and makes bets with others around the world. We  have a log-in page that pulls your account from our server so we can make sure you have a safe gamble on the website.
